1. Missing Data Imputation code: 
A data science research project which explored different methods and ground rules for handling missing data values. In our case, a financial dataset was taken and different packages in Python and R were studied, implemented and compared with each other. Using this study, conclusions and rules were formed for different missing data scenarios.

2. Prediction of Detroit blight violation payments: 
Blight violations are issued by Detroit city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year many of these fines remain unpaid and enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process. The first step towards increasing blight ticket compliance is understanding when and why a resident might fail to comply with a blight ticket, using predictie modelling and Machine Learning. Our algorithm using Random Forest Classifier acheived a max AUC score of 0.79 when predicting whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time.
